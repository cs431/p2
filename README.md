# CS 431 Project 2

 To execute via command line, compile all .java files and run with the input file as a command line argument. <br>
 To obtain the output in a file rather than on the console, redirect output into [outputfilename].[desired file extension].

 For example, after compiling: <br>
 $ java cs431.cpu <input file path> > output.csv <br>
 and output.csv will be in your current working directory.
